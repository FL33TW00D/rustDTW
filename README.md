## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Installation

To install rustDTW, simply:

```shell
pip install rustdtw
```

## Example Usage
  
rustDTW was designed for usage with timeseries data from functional brain regions. However any data represented as a numpy matrix can be provided.
```python
import numpy as np
import rust_dtw
  
rust_dtw.dtw(s=np.array([0., 1., 2.]), t=np.array([3., 4., 5.]), window=50, distance_mode="euclidean")
>>> 5.0990195
```
  
## Developing

### Built With
- PyO3
- Maturin
- rust-numpy
- Rayon


### Setting up Dev

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/your-project.git
cd your-project/
packagemanager install
```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here. for example:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

## Tests

All tests are implemented using pytest.
```shell
poetry run pytest
```

## üìà Performance
How well does the Rust implementation stack up against some other Python/C versions.
