## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Installation

To install rustDTW, simply:

```shell
pip install rust-dtw
```

## Example Usage
  
rustDTW was designed for usage with timeseries data from functional brain regions. However any data represented as a numpy matrix can be provided.
```python
import numpy as np
import rust_dtw
  
rust_dtw.dtw(
  s=np.array([0., 1., 2.]), 
  t=np.array([3., 4., 5.]), 
  window=50, 
  distance_mode="euclidean"
  )
>>> 5.0990195
```
