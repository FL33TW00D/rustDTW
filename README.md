## ⚡️ Quick start

To install rustDTW, simply:

```shell
pip install rustdtw
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.

## Developing

### Built With
- PyO3
- Maturin
- rust-numpy
- Rayon
- and more!

### Prerequisites
What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools. include download links.


### Setting up Dev

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/your-project.git
cd your-project/
packagemanager install
```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here. for example:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Deploying / Publishing
give instructions on how to build and release a new version
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.



## Tests

All tests are implemented using pytest.
```shell
Give an example
```

## Performance
How well does the Rust implementation stack up against some other Python versions.
